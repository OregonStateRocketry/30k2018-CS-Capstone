Abstract:
The Spaceport America Cup is an international engineering competition to design, build, and fly a student-made rocket to 30,000 feet.  The competition is scored on several criteria including the software components outlined by this problem statement.  These software components control the rocket avionics, record and display near real time telemetry, and later display the results from an scientific payload.
