\section{Project Overview}
\subsection{Introduction}
This project will design, write, and test software that will fly on board the Oregon State University's entry to the Spaceport America Cup's 30k Challenge.  The Spaceport America Cup is an international engineering competition to design, build, and fly a student-made rocket to 30,000 feet.  The competition is scored on several criteria including software components like flight avionics, recording and displaying telemetry, and conducting a scientific experiment during flight.

% ==============================================================================

\section{Major Design Components}

\subsection{Overview of design elements}

This project requires that multiple pieces of software and hardware work together to accomplish our mission.

The rocket will carry at least two flight computers which will record on-board flight data, as well as multiple telemetry modules that will record and transmit flight data during flight.  During the flight we will capture and display live telemetry data, which will be further improved after the flight by importing stored data from the flight computers and telemetry modules.

The on-board flight computers will also perform important tasks during the flight.  The rocket avionics will use inertial measurement units and other sensors to detect apogee and trigger separation of the rocket, as well as deploy the drogue and main parachutes.  The payload avionics will use accelerometers to measure gravity and engage a propeller to accelerate the payload downward, to create a micro gravity environment for the scientific experiment.

On the ground, a set of affordable computers will be connected to radios which will receive the live telemetry signals.  These computers will parse out text from the incoming audio stream, and store that information over a local network and into a database.

Nearby team members and spectators will be encouraged to use their laptops, tablets and cell phones to connect to a WiFi network to access a web page containing a flight summary and graphs of acceleration, velocity, and altitude, among others.  These graphs will be generated in nearly real time using information from the database.

After the rocket has landed and been recovered, we will use the parsers to import additional data from the on-board computers, into the database.  This will provide a large amount of additional data and allow us to display additional graphs and information about the flight.

\subsection{Avionics}

\subsubsection{Rocket Avionics}

(Allison rocket avionics here)

\subsubsection{Payload Avionics}

Levi Willmeth will manage writing the payload avionics for this project.

The scientific payload will carry a brushless motor and ESC, several IMU's, a Raspberry Pi Zero flight computer, a video camera, and a BeeLineGPS telemetry module.  The flight computer will be turned on several minutes before launch and record up-close video of the scientific experiment throughout the flight.  It will also read acceleration and attitude data from each of the IMU's to detect separation and measure the amount of gravity experienced by the experiment.  After separation has been detected, the flight computer will begin increasing the speed of the motor to propel the payload downward, which will reduce acceleration felt by the experiment.  The goal of the experiment is to achieve zero gravity for as long as possible, which we estimate will be 10-12 seconds.

Accurately detecting separation and ejection from the body of the rocket will be a critical task for the payload avionics.  If the payload begins to spin the propeller before being ejected from the body of the rocket, it will immediately destroy the propeller and possibly damage other portions of the rocket.  The motor is powerful enough that if held still while being powered, it could draw enough current to easily start a fire.  It will be important to develop an accurate, not precise, method to determine when the rocket has separated and the payload has been ejected from the body of the rocket.

Because we are unable to add physical components like a manual switch or wire connecting the payload to the body of the rocket, we will need to rely on our sensors.  The payload will carry multiple 6 degree of freedom IMU's which will give us acceleration and gyroscopic readings in the x, y, and z planes.  We will be able to use these sensors to remain in an idle state during launch, glide, and finally to detect the rather large impulse forces created during separation and ejection.

We plan to modeling the avionics system as a state machine with pre-launch, launch, glide, separation, microgravity, and parachute states.  This type of direct, forward progression allows us to design a state machine which prevents the payload avionics from inadvertently returning to a previous state, and gives us a solid idea of what behaviors to look for in order to transition to the next state.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[->,shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=2.8cm,semithick]
  \node[initial,state]	(P)			{Pre-Launch};
  \node[state]	(L) [right of=P]	{Launch};
  \node[state]	(G)	[right of=L]	{Glide};
  \node[state]	(S)	[right of=G]	{Separation};
  \node[state]	(M)	[right of=S]	{Microgravity};
  \node[state]	(C)	[right of=M]	{Parachute};

  \path	(M)	edge [right]	node{}	(C);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Conceptual state diagram for payload avionics.}
\end{figure}

For example, during the pre-launch state we can effectively ignore all sensor readings until we see a very high acceleration on the z axis, which signals launch.  We can begin logging all sensor values from that point on (or even retroactively record a set of rolling pre-launch values) until we see the z axis acceleration end, which signals that we have entered the glide state.  Obviously we will need to look at more than a single sensor value to transition between states, but the general idea is to understand what we can expect during each phase of launch, and encode those conditions as state transitions.

\subsubsection{Avionics Testing}
The CS and ECE teams will be writing avionics for the rocket and payload which will be able to determine when separation should occur. Due to the high degree of precision that this requires and the significant negative consequences of failure for this code, ensuring the functionality of this code is of the utmost importance. It is also standard within the aerospace industry to very thoroughly test any and all avionics code, meaning that writing a thorough test suite will be good practice for working within the aerospace or related industries. There are three types of testing that the team has decided to carry out, hardware tests, unit tests, and simulation with robustness tests. The CS team will cooperate with the ECE team to perform the first and likely the second to some degree, and will manage the third.

Hardware tests will involve making certain that each sensor is functional, powered, and giving reasonable readings. This will largely be handled by the ECE team, but Joshua will take responsibility to ensure that the ECE team has thoroughly tested every piece of electronics on the Payload and the Rocket. 

Unit tests will involve making sure that the basic functionality of the code is intact. This will mean ensuring that the programs and functions written to read from sensors give accurate output to a given input. These will mostly be used to test code reading from sensors, or that the code will trigger certain events when given input that should do so (such as triggering separation when inputs suggest the rocket has reached it’s apex). Some tests may be written to ensure a minimum degree of robustness, such as throwing out inputs that are invalid (such as an input that is a string of characters that should be a number). Joshua will oversee the writing of unit tests on avionics code. He will check to ensure that the goals for line coverage are met by the unit tests, and aim to have the unit tests ensure all code functions correctly to expected inputs.

The final aspect of testing the avionics code is to simulate a launch with robustness testing. This will involve encapsulating the functionality of the code for triggering flight events in some manner, and then testing that code against simulated inputs. These inputs will then be randomly altered in a variety of manners. If possible, this will be extended to include testing of code for sensor interaction, with the code interacting with simulated sensors rather than actual sensors. The randomization will likely take one of the following forms, but may include other forms if the code calls for it. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Throwing a value that is out of bounds (this included the following)
\begin{itemize}
\item A value that is of the wrong type
\item A value that is too large
\item A value that is too small
\end{itemize}
\item Having a sensor cease responding
\item Having a sensor continually send the same value
\item Offsetting a sensor’s outputs by some set amount for the rest of the launch
\item Having a sensor feed a value that is not out of bounds, but is not correct
\item Having a sensor feed values for the rest of the launch that are incorrect and
\begin{itemize}
\item in bounds 
\item out of bounds
\item either in or out of bounds
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The number of randomized failures will be able to be set at the start of the test, but not timing or the types of failures. Some failures may be weighted as being more significant, and therefore valued as a larger number of failures. The test will not be given a clear pass fail, but will instead push the outputs of the avionics code to a csv, which will be compared against the csv output of the code with no randomization as well as the inputs given by the simulation.

\subsection{Telemetry and Importing Flight Data}

\subsubsection{Transmitting Telemetry}

The ECE subteam selected the BigRedBee BeeLineGPS telemetry module which cannot be used with additional sensors and only transmits using APRS formatting.  This means that we cannot control which fields are being transmitted, or the packet formatting of the telemetry data.  Each transmitter will send a packet once per second, containing the latitude, longitude, and altitude of the transmitter.  These packets will be transmitted as audio data and can be decoded into a string in the APRS format.

There will be two telemetry transmitters in use during the flight.  One will be in the nosecone of the rocket, and the other will separate with the payload.  They will be on slightly different radio frequencies because the timing is not guaranteed, so the signals may overlap.

\subsubsection{Receiving Telemetry}

Levi Willmeth will manage parsing and storing telemetry for this project.

We will be using a software TNC called Direwolf to decode the audio tones into strings of text.  Because the timing is not guaranteed and the signals may overlap, we will be using one primary receiver per radio signal, with an additional secondary receiver for redundancy.  We expect to use four raspberry pi zeros to receive two incoming radio signals, to provide redundancy during signal processing.

% Processing each signal will be done using affordable Raspberry Pi Zero computers, which will be connected and networked to a more powerful Raspberry Pi 3 B computer, using an OTG USB cable.  This will allow each of the parsing computers to be powered and networked using a single wire.  All of the ground computers will be housed in a portable, hard-shell carrying case that also contains a USB power bank.  This will allow us to turn on the system, and begin parsing on multiple radio channels without any additional steps.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{images/parser_diagram.eps}
    \caption{Flow of information into the parser.}
\end{figure}

When the parsing computers boot up, they will immediately begin running the Direwolf software that allows them to receive an audio source and parse it into a string of text.\cite{direwolf}  They will also begin running a Python script to take the input string from Direwolf, validate it for content, and insert individual fields into a database on the local network.  The database will be described in section \ref{subsec:database} of this document.  These programs will be started as services so that they can be stopped, started, or automatically restart themselves as needed.\cite{script-as-service}

Because we are using analog radio inputs, the string may be from our rocket, or it may be from an unrelated transmitter on the same frequency.  We will use Python to parse the string, validate that it contains the correct radio call sign for our payload or rocket, and perform a checksum to test for corruption during transmittal.

If the packet does not pass checksum, contains an invalid call sign, or does not contain the correct data fields, a warning will be added to the parser log and the string will be inserted into a special database table for invalid inputs.  This will allow us to inspect errors without discarding any data.

The parsing program will be configured to either process incoming strings from Direwolf, or to search a given directory for well-formatted files.  This will allow the same parsing program that listens for radio inputs, to parse the data recorded and stored on board the rocket and payload during flight.

After the flight, a human operator will be able to remove the SD card from the rocket and payload avionics flight computers, plug the SD card into a laptop, and point the parsing program at the SD card.  The parsing program will scan the directory (or individual file) and determine from the header which device created it.  Using the appropriate table name and steps similar to those used while parsing radio inputs, the parsing program will split the strings into individual fields and insert them into the network database.

\subsection{Database}
\label{subsec:database}

Levi Willmeth will set up and manage a MariaDB database for this project.

This project will collect several hundred thousand lines of sensor data, using several different sources.  All of this data will need to be sortable and searchable in order to interpret the results of our flight.  Furthermore, we want to be able to record and analyze different flights independently.  Using a database to store our flight data will allow us to accomplish all of these goals.

Because the rocket avionics records different types of sensors than the payload avionics or the radio telemetry modules, we will use one table per type of data source.  That means one table will hold all data received from a BeeLineGPS telemetry module, another table will hold all data imported from the payload avionics, and so on.  These tables will also need to relate to each other in order to allow the display program to make appropriate connections between different sensors recorded on different hardware.  This will be done using a Flight table with a primary key that will be used as a foreign key on each of the individual data tables.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/database.eps}
    \caption{Early draft of the database schema.}
\end{figure}

When the telemetry parsing Python script begins, it will check the Flights table of the database to see if there is a flight record with an Active status.  This table and field will be used to synchronize the parsers so that records from one radio frequency can be related to records from another frequency at the same time.  The Flights table has a primary key called 'flight\_id' that is used as a foreign key on all other tables.

To eliminate duplicate rows caused by using redundant receivers, we will use a MySQL query that first checks if a row exists, before inserting a new row.  This can be done as a single query: \cite{unique-sql-insert}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
INSERT INTO
	BeelineGPS (f_id, time, lat, lon, alt, callsign)
SELECT
	* FROM (SELECT $cur_time, $cur_flight_id) AS tmp
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT id FROM BeelineGPS WHERE time = $cur_time
) LIMIT 1;
\end{lstlisting}

There may be situations where a given timestamp contains data across multiple tables.  For example, the rocket avionics may record some types of data at 100 Hz, and other types of data at only 10 Hz.  Some of these records may share an identical timestamp, others may not.  That is why we are using multiple tables and a foreign key instead of one larger table and assuming our timestamp is unique.

While graphing this data, we are likely to want to relate data from different tables.  For example if we recorded latitude and longitude in the BeelineGPS table, and acceleration in the Rocket\_Avionics table, we may want to combine that data to see our acceleration at different points across a map.  This is where the database becomes exceptionally useful compared to flat files.  We can use a join query to select records from both tables, based on the knowledge that they will have identical f\_id's and similar timestamps.  The syntax would look something like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
SELECT
	BeelineGPS.lat, BeelineGPS.lon, Rocket_Avionics.acc_x
FROM
	BeelineGPS
INNER JOIN
	Rocket_Avionics
ON
	BeelineGPS.f_id=Rocket_Avionics.f_id
WHERE
	BeelineGPS.flight_id=$cur_flight;
\end{lstlisting}

In this example the latitude may be sampled at only 1 Hz while acceleration could be sampled at closer to 100 Hz.  We could choose to average out many acceleration values to find the best fit at the moment we recorded the latitude, or we could let MySQL find a single value using the Rocket\_Avionics timestamp closest to the BeelineGPS timestamp.  The syntax for that query could look something like this: \cite{sql-foreign-key}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
SELECT
	BeelineGPS.lat, BeelineGPS.lon, Rocket_Avionics.acc_x
FROM
	BeelineGPS
INNER JOIN
	Rocket_Avionics
ON
	BeelineGPS.f_id=Rocket_Avionics.f_id
WHERE (
	SELECT
		timestamp
	FROM
		Rocket_Avionics
	WHERE
		BeelineGPS.timestamp >= (Rocket_Avionics.timestamp-100)
	AND
		BeelineGPS.timestamp <= (Rocket_Avionics.timestamp+100)
	ORDER BY
		abs(BeelineGPS.timestamp - Rocket_Avionics.timestamp)
	LIMIT 1
);
\end{lstlisting}
